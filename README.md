Apache Pinot is a real-time OLAP data store that can provide ultra low latency even at high throughput. It can ingest data from batch data sources such as Hadoop, S3, Azure and Google cloud storage or from streaming data sources such as Kafka, EventHub, Kinesis.

## How to setup a Pinot cluster
In the tutorial, we will setup a Pinot cluster with the following components
* 1 zookeeper
* 3 controllers
* 2 brokers
* 2 servers
Once the cluster is up and running, we see how to load data into Pinot and query it.
At the end, we show how Pinot is resilient to failures
